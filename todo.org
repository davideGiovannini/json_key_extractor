** TODO Avoid loading all file in ram (the queue).
  If it contains above N elements wait until they are processed (below N).
***  Even better use a command line option to set max ram usage/policy

** TODO try this [spmc](https://docs.rs/spmc/0.2.1/spmc/) instead of crossbeam::MSQUEUE
** TODO handle italian dates (dd/mm/yyyy)
